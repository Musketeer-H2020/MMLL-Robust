	Install instructions under Linux OS
=====================================================================================

- It is adviceable to install a python distribution like Anaconda (Python 3.7). Please proceeed to the Anaconda download page (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and follow the instructions according to your Operative System

- Once Anaconda is correctly installed, open a bash/dash terminal and execute the following commands:

conda update conda

conda update anaconda

- Next, we create a conda environment with all the required libraries (Note that the next command is a single line)

conda create -n demo python=3.7.4 flask requests numpy ipython scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm pytorch-cpu torchvision seaborn transitions==0.6.9 pygraphviz==1.5 -c pytorch -c defaults -c conda-forge --yes

You may need some assistance from a System Manager if you fail to install the Python required libraries.


Uncompress the file D4_6.zip. In the D4_6 folder, you should find the following subfolder structure:

demo/
documentation_html/
input_data/
MMLL/
results/

* demo: the folder where the execution scripts are

* documentation_html: the folder where the software documentation is. To browse it, just open the index file in it by double-clicking on it. The documentation will be shown in a web browser.

* input_data: some small datasets are provided for running the demos. If you want to execute any demo with a larger dataset, you must download them from this link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NOMvmppt5qfGmGjA14hsdsTgB9KD7_Oz), but the provided datasets are enough to explore the Machine Learning Library usage.

* MMLL: The Musketeer Machine Learning Library (POMs 4, 5 and 6)

* results. Some output figures are saved here. Also a subfolder with execution logs is available.
