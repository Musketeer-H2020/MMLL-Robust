'''
This file contains the abstract class to implement an attack and also two instances that must be implemented by the participants:

- ImplementedAttack1

- ImplementedAttack2

This attack will be used by two workers in the hackathon, the goal is to reduce the accuracy in a scenario where 8 workers are honest and 2 workers are malicious.
